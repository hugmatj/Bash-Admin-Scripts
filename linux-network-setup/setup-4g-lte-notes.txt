Basically i8nstall modem manager, this gives you mmcli (modem manager cli)
You should have nmcli (network manager cli)

# This isn't needed since you can use '*' instead of the specific device
MODEM_PORT=$(mmcli -m 0  |grep 'primary port:' | awk '{ print $4 }'); echo ${MODEM_PORT}
cdc-wdm0

MODEM_DEV=$(mmcli -m 0  |grep 'device: ' | awk '{ print $4 }'); echo ${MODEM_DEV}
/sys/devices/platform/soc/ffe09000.usb/ff500000.usb/xhci-hcd.2.auto/usb1/1-1/1-1.3

# Just let network manager guess the only modem installed
# and set it up for Ting as ting0 apn for their newer 5G where APN is wholesale
nmcli c add type gsm ifname '*' con-name ting0 apn wholesale

# show the network connections
nmcli c

# Setup wifi

up [id | uuid | path] ID [ifname ifname] [ap BSSID] [passwd-file file]
           Activate a connection. The connection is identified by its name, UUID or D-Bus path. If ID is
           ambiguous, a keyword id, uuid or path can be used. When requiring a particular device to
           activate the connection on, the ifname option with interface name should be given. If the ID is
           not given an ifname is required, and NetworkManager will activate the best available connection
           for the given ifname. In case of a VPN connection, the ifname option specifies the device of the
           base connection. The ap option specify what particular AP should be used in case of a Wi-Fi
           connection.
    passwd-file
               some networks may require credentials during activation. You can give these credentials
               using this option. Each line of the file should contain one password in the form:

                   setting_name.property_name:the password

               For example, for WPA Wi-Fi with PSK, the line would be

                   802-11-wireless-security.psk:secret12345

    nmcli device status
           shows the status for all devices.

       nmcli dev disconnect em2
           disconnects a connection on interface em2 and marks the device as unavailable for
           auto-connecting. As a result, no connection will automatically be activated on the device until
           the device's 'autoconnect' is set to TRUE or the user manually activates a connection.

       nmcli -f GENERAL,WIFI-PROPERTIES dev show wlan0
           shows details for wlan0 interface; only GENERAL and WIFI-PROPERTIES sections will be shown.

       nmcli -f CONNECTIONS device show wlp3s0
           shows all available connection profiles for your Wi-Fi interface wlp3s0.

       nmcli dev wifi
           lists available Wi-Fi access points known to NetworkManager.

       nmcli dev wifi con "Cafe Hotspot 1" password caffeine name "My cafe"
           creates a new connection named "My cafe" and then connects it to "Cafe Hotspot 1" SSID using
           password "caffeine". This is mainly useful when connecting to "Cafe Hotspot 1" for the first
           time. Next time, it is better to use nmcli con up id "My cafe" so that the existing connection
           profile can be used and no additional is created.

       nmcli -s dev wifi hotspot con-name QuickHotspot
           creates a hotspot profile and connects it. Prints the hotspot password the user should use to
           connect to the hotspot from other devices.


# no wrky
# nmcli c add type wifi ifname '*' ap WIFI_SSID 

nmcli c add type wifi ifname '*' ap WIFI_SSID 
nmcli dev wifi con "WIFI_SSID" password 'WIFII_PASS' name 'WIFI_SSID'

# After setting them up, there are files in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
# for each config, by name

WIFI_SSID.nmconnection
ting0.nmconnection
